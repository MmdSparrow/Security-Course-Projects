<h1 align="center">Security Course Projects</h1>

This repository contains five security-related projects developed as part of a university security course:

1. **DES & 3DES**
   Implementation of the Data Encryption Standard (DES) and Triple DES cryptographic algorithms.

2. **Diffie–Hellman**
   A practical implementation of the Diffie–Hellman key exchange protocol.

3. **RSA**
   An implementation of the RSA public‑key cryptosystem, including key generation and encryption/decryption operations.

4. **Man-in-the-Middle Attack (MITM)**
   Demonstrates a MITM attack using ARP spoofing. The script monitors a user-specified network interface to intercept HTTP traffic, extract visited URLs, and detect sensitive information such as usernames and passwords transmitted in request payloads.

5. **Packet Analyzer**
   A network packet sniffer that captures live traffic on a specified port, identifies packets containing TLS data, and prints detailed information about TLS handshakes and records.
